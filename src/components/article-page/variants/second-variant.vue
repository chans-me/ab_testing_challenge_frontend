        <p>Making Sound Waves: How Blinkist Creates Award-Winning Audio</p>
      </v-card-title>
      <v-card-subtitle class="display-1 deep-purple--text">
        How did we turn Blinkist from a text-only app into an audio powerhouse? Let's take a look at the decks to find out.

        <p class="subtitle-1">Most of us will recognize the distinctive ta-dum of Netflix starting up, associate a lion’s roar with MGM, or get twitchy thumbs when we hear the opening notes of a favorite video game. Sound informs how we relate with the world and our feelings about a brand become linked to its logo. The team at Blinkist realized early on that a great app experience would be intimately connected to its soundscape. </p>

        <p class="subtitle-1">Blinkist spent years developing its world-class audio experience, crafting engaging, high-quality narration, music and sound design. Now, an app that began as a delivery system for key ideas from the best nonfiction books has grown into an expansive audiovisual experience. Having already won awards for its visual design, Blinkist’s audio branding won a Better Sound Award in 2020 at the International Sound Awards and most recently, won a 2021 German Design Award for Excellent Communications Design Brand Identity.</p>

        <p class="headline font-weight-bold">From Insight to Foresight</p>

        <p class="subtitle-1">After Blinkist was founded in 2012, audio versions of Blinks—that’s what we call our packs of key nonfiction insights—became its most requested feature. While there were solutions readily available, Blinkist had something more ambitious in mind.</p>
        
        <p class="subtitle-1">“At the time, the more common solution was to have a computer program reading off the text,” said Ben Schuman-Stoler, Head of Audio at Blinkist. “The podcasting boom was in full swing at the time, too, so working with real people and voices felt really innovative.”</p>
        
        <p class="subtitle-1">It needed to be more than just reading the text, though. The audio Blinks needed to strike the right tone. Ben and Odysseas Constantinou, Audio Production and Development at Blinkist, went back and forth with the team of writers about the best delivery. Ultimately, they decided on a warm and inviting tone as if in conversation with the listener. And by the end of 2014, readers could listen to their favorite titles.</p>

        <p class="headline font-weight-bold">On a New Wavelength</p>

        <p class="subtitle-1">2017 proved to be a pivotal year for the Blinkist audio experience. The design team’s creation of a visual language for Blinkist landed them a Google Material Design Award for Brand Expressiveness and the audio team took note.</p>
        
        <p class="subtitle-1">“We saw the way they were able to communicate a message through the visuals and establish an intentional relationship with the audience,” said Odysseas. “After that, we wondered if we could translate that to the audio experience.”</p>
        
        <p class="subtitle-1">With such a huge demand for audio content coming from Blinkist customers and from the broader market, the company decided to shift to an audio-first mentality. This required an expansive overview of the soundscape within the company’s products—there were the Blinks, podcasts, videos, the (now-discontinued) Minute, to name just a few. But what held it all together? What made it sound uniquely Blinkist?Up to that point, all of the assets for branding and marketing had been bought from stock music services or elsewhere. However, this posed a risk. If another brand used the same material, it made standing out more difficult. The team knew that to create a distinctive premium product, the sound in the app needed to measure up to the high standard of the written Blinks. Creating bespoke audio branding would solve the problems they were facing.</p>
